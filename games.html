    <h3>Mini Cooper</h3>
    <h6>built with foundation</h6>
    <p>There’s nothing small about the effects on this “Mini” website and its use of scrolling as a fly-around of its eponymous car. The parallax steps aside on mobile for a neat intuitive image layout. The hamburger menu spins into action when clicked revealing a gorgeous dropdown.</p>

    <h3>Marriott GoPro</h3>
    <h6>built with foundation</h6>
    <p>It’s hard to fault GoPro for their efforts to make their site, partnered with Marriott, friendly towards mobile devices. But it’s the active photography that makes us want to go. Watch the full screen background video or scale the browser down to see the map conform to smaller screen.</p>

    <h3>Barclay's</h3>
    <h6>built with foundation</h6>
    <p>Many investment companies are moving towards responsive designs, but Barclay’s looks exceptionally well on smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktop computers. The site uses many smart techniques to get users where they need to go on a small device. They employ a multi-level off-canvas and in-section navigation to achieve a good user flow.</p>
